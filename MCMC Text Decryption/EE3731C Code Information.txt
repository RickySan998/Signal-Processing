Information About Code
1. The implementation of the extension to Metropolis Algorithm for improved decryption is done in mcmc_decrypt_text_modified.m
2. To run this code, for frank case simply do
pr_trans = compute_transition_probability(training_txt);
[decrypted_txt,decrypt_key] = mcmc_decrypt_text_modified(frank_encrypted_txt,pr_trans);
where the training_txt is the one given in sem1_2018_encrypt.mat

3. To decrypt the mystery text using the modified algorithm, do
load('new_training_txt.mat');
pr_trans_2 = compute_transition_probability(new_training_txt);
[decrypted_txt,decrypt_key] = mcmc_decrypt_text_modified(mystery_encrypted_txt,pr_trans_2);

4. The file code3731c.m contains codes that are used to print outputs that are requested in the project document. Note that these commands
could also be run in the command line instead
